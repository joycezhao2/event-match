Welcome to EventMatch! This is a user interface designed by Angela Wang ('20), Joyce Zhao ('20), and Marily Karageorgiou ('20) as a final project for Spring 2018 CS 220, Human Computer Interaction at Wellesley College.

Many students want to get outside the “Wellesley Bubble” and attend events at other college campuses, but there is not a single source where students can find information about off-campus events. Our mobile app allows users to explore information about events at other colleges such as sports games, cultural shows or hackathons. We hope this platform can enhance intercampus communication about events that students from different colleges seek to attend. By fostering greater community engagement between college students, we aim to promote more diverse educational and social opportunities.

Our design process consisted of initial user, task, and requirement analysis as we brainstormed different solutions to common issues on our campus. We then drew up several paper prototypes and conducted many pilot and user tests. Our final project was presented during the Human Computer Interaction open house during Spring 2018.
